# GitHub Profile Setup Guide

## 🐍 Snake Game Setup

The snake game is automatically generated by a GitHub Action. To trigger it manually:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select **Generate Snake Game** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

The snake animation will appear in your README after the workflow completes (usually takes 1-2 minutes).

## 📊 GitHub Stats

The GitHub stats use the `github-readme-stats` API. If you see errors:

1. **Rate Limiting**: The API may be rate-limited. Wait a few minutes and refresh.
2. **Cache**: Stats are cached for 24 hours (`cache_seconds=86400`) to reduce API calls.
3. **Private Repos**: Set `count_private=false` if you don't want private repo stats.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Snake Game Not Showing
- Check if the `output/` directory exists in your repo
- Verify the workflow ran successfully in the Actions tab
- Ensure the file path in README matches: `output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg`

### Stats Not Loading
- The API might be temporarily down - wait and refresh
- Check your username is correct: `GSL006`
- Try accessing the API URL directly in your browser

### Workflow Errors
- Ensure repository has Actions enabled
- Check that the workflow has write permissions
- Verify you're on the `main` branch

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Commit and push** all files to your repository
2. **Go to Actions tab** and manually trigger the snake workflow
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the workflow to complete
4. **Refresh your profile** to see the snake animation

## 📝 Notes

- The snake game updates every 6 hours automatically
- Stats cache for 24 hours to reduce API load
- All workflows run on GitHub's free tier
